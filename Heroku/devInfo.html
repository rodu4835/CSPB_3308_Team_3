          		    This web page was created by students at the University of
          		    Colorado Boulder for the final project in our software development
          		    course during the spring of 2022. The page runs a coded version of
          		    the classic card game &apos;War&apos; in which the user has
          		    entered their name and plays against the computer through rounds.
          		    The back end Javascript code builds a deck of cards, shuffles it,
          		    splits it into two hands (one for each player), then draws the top
          		    card from each hand and compares them. The hand that had the
          		    higher card gets the pot. In a situation where the cards are tied,
          		    the program will draw three more cards from each hand and compare
          		    the fourth card. Once one player runs out of card, the other is
          		    determined to be the winner of the game. If you wish to learn more
          		    about the project and see our source code, please click the link
          		    above to our GitHub Repository.
