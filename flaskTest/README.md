This folder for testing HTML and flask hosting for our project

added testpics.py to figure out how to link the images with their cards in our source code
	ended up changing the touples to embeded lists in order to add the file path as the third element in each item in the main list

	[card, value, image filepath]

then, using opencv and cv2 it tests the filepath functionality by showing the image

will test functionality and layout of HTML steps next then implement into main project code
