### Project Title: WAR, What is it Good for? This Project

About This Project
This web page was created by students at the University of Colorado Boulder for the final project in our software development course during the spring of 2022. The page runs a coded version of the classic card game 'War' in which the user has entered their name and plays against the computer through rounds. The back end Javascript code builds a deck of cards, shuffles it, splits it into two hands (one for each player), then draws the top card from each hand and compares them. The hand that had the higher card gets the pot. In a situation where the cards are tied, the program will draw three more cards from each hand and compare the fourth card. Once one player runs out of card, the other is determined to be the winner of the game.

  - Spring 2022
  - CSPB 3308 Software Development

Team Members:
  - Jordan Sims
  - Cassandra A. Cohen
  - Grant Fairbairn
  - Ronald Durham

Vision Statement:
  - We plan to code a visual representation of the classic card game War. 

Motivation:
  - All of our group memmbers are interested and enjoy games.
  - It will provide enough difficulty for the project assignment but not too much to be outside our scope. 

Risks to Project Completion:
  - New working environment
  - Creating a card structure
  - Coding Visuals overall

Mitigation Strategy For Above Risks:
  - Researching the new environment
  - Focuson on using Python for our code to create the card structure
  - Possibly Python librarys for our visuals and art

Development Method:
  - Scrum
    - Weekly sprints, bi-weekly stand ups
    - Talk about goals for each weeek and what our focus will be  

Project Tracking Software:
  - Github Project
